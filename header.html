    <h2>Helping Individuals With Life Circumstances!!!</h2>

    <h2><strong>Background On Company</strong></h2>
    <p>I realized the lack of knowledge that the
        community has when it involves the rental criteria. I have witnessed countless
        evictions, kept security deposits, outstanding balances, and over 11,500 people
        and counting experiencing homelessness on a daily basis.
        After Years of working within the property management community, I was able to
        gain the knowledge that will help the community throughout the entire nation. I
        became experienced with Fair Housing, GraceHill, and Franklin County Eviction
        Court. I am currently working with County Children services throughout Ohio to
        implement an Eviction Prevention Program to ensure that Individuals & families
        can strive for stability and overcome the barriers of Housing needs and concerns.
