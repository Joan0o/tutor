<p>Hello Joan,</p>
<p>Welcome to our first review together! I hope you are enjoying tutoring. Thank you for helping many students recently!
   You are doing a great job being welcoming and patient in your sessions :)&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have reviewed your stats and some of your sessions since your last quality check and wanted to make a few
   comments.<br /><br /><strong>Approach</strong><br />As noted above, Below Expectations has been marked in this Review
   for Approach. The purpose of this Below Expectations is to address recurring/ongoing concerns with the quality of
   your tutoring sessions. This Review will provide you with resources and strategies you can use to be successful with
   the service and ensure our students have the best possible sessions.<br />I noticed that in several sessions you
   suggest corrections and give answers to the students. For example in this sessions: 08/18/2024 11:50 AM, 07/28/2024
   06:42 PM, 09/04/2024 06:50 PM, 09/04/2024 06:25 PM, 07/28/2024 08:09 PM: <br /><em>Joan V (Tutor)0:27:30 this is what
      i'd answer</em><br /><em>1. &iquest;Les prestas dinero a tus amigos/as?</em><br /><em>S&iacute;, se los
      presto.</em><br /><em>2. &iquest;Qui&eacute;n te va a preparar la cena hoy?</em><br /><em>S&iacute;, me la va a
      preparar mi abuela.</em><br /><em>3. &iquest;Le compras regalos a tu madre?
      &iquest;Cu&aacute;ndo?</em><br /><em>S&iacute;, se los compr&eacute; la semana pasada.</em><br /><em>4.
      &iquest;Qui&eacute;n te ense&ntilde;a el espa&ntilde;ol?</em><br /><em>Mi profesora de espa&ntilde;ol me lo
      ense&ntilde;a.</em><br /><em>Sean0:29:40 Ok but I still don't understand #4 on section
      3<br /></em><br /><em>Saanvi 0:01:36Pablo says Vuelvo a la una. ............. (querer) ver el
      partido</em><br /><em>Saanvi 0:01:42i need to fll it in</em><br /><em>Saanvi 0:03:51 -------------(Recordar) (tu')
      que nuestro equipo es muy bueno? ! Puede (poder) ganar!</em><br /><em>Joan V (Tutor) 0:04:37fisrt is quiero
   </em><br /><em>Joan V (Tutor) 0:04:40second is recuerdas</em><br /><em>Saanvi 0:05:31No, --------------(pensar) que
      vamos a perder. </em><br /><em>Joan V (Tutor) 0:05:55pienso</em><br /><em>Saanvi 0:06:32ok</em> <br /><br />We
   want to engage the student in the solving of their own problem for a few reasons. One, it helps them take ownership
   of their work, which invests them in doing well in their class. Two, it creates and improves problem solving
   techniques that they can apply to a variety of subjects in school. Lastly, it allows the student to ratain more
   information so in the future they will be able to solve similar problems on their own. <br />Telling the student what
   to do may solve the problem, but it usually fails to meet the three goals mentioned earlier. In those illustrative
   sessions, you simply tell the student the answer. Instead, we can ask leading questions, for instance: "are you
   familiar with the Present Tense?", "How do you think we can conjugate the verb 'querer' in this sentence?" or "What
   would be your first step?". In this way we create a situation where the student has to think about what they have
   learned about this concept and tell us an action plan to move forward with the problem. The following example
   sessions may be helpful to give you some ideas:
   https://www.tutor.com/providers/content_templates/engagementexamplesfinal1<br /><br /><strong>Policies and
      Procedures</strong> <br />I have also noticed that some sessions ended abruptly, for example: 09/04/2024 08:08 PM
   and 09/24/2024 08:08 PM, while some others were transferred due to being "out of scope": 07/25/2024 08:57 PM and
   08/18/2024 04:42 PM. If a request appears to be out of scope for the subject, please accept and redirect the student
   so they are not left waiting in a queue where they cannot get help. Do not transfer these sessions, as the student
   will get sent to another tutor in the same incorrect subject. In this session 08/18/2024 04:42 PM the student waited
   for 1 hour after you transferred her to get another tutor who told her to reconnect under the correct subject. You
   can reference the Basic Concepts List to determine what is in scope, and see the Tutor Resource Manual for more on
   routing out of scope requests.<br /><br />In this session 09/08/2024 04:59 PM the student was unresponsive for 15
   minutes. This does occur from time to time due to various circumstances, and we have a procedure in place for how to
   handle these situations. As the Tutor Resource Manual states, when a student is unresponsive (either right away or
   becomes unresponsive during the session), a tutor should wait no more than a total of 4-8 minutes for the student to
   respond. Using the prescripts available (for example: "I'll only be able to wait a few more minutes...","Since I
   haven't heard from you..."), we can give the student opportunities to respond, and when no response is given, even
   after sending the prescripts, we can end the session.<br /><br /><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong><br />As a
   tutor, it&rsquo;s important to understand how to use this tool, to support students while maintaining integrity in
   the learning process.<br />I noticed that you referred to ChatGPT in some of your sessions. For example: 07/21/2024
   06:08 PM :v <br /><em>Joan V (Tutor)0:04:38 so I asked gpt and this is what it had to say </em><br /><em>Joan V
      (Tutor)0:06:19 gpt says it is passive </em><br /><em>Joan V (Tutor)0:10:42 gpt says its a
      pronoun</em><br /><br />AI can be utilized to research information or to verify an answer on the tutor&rsquo;s
   behalf to help guide a session. However, in no circumstance should AI generated feedback be copied and pasted into
   the chat taking the place of meaningful discussion between tutor and student. We should not be using AI to create
   responses to students. I encourage you to review the expectations as noted in the Basic Concepts List
   (http://www.tutor.com/cmspublicfiles/WWW/concept-list.pdf) and brush up on topics with which you may be uncertain.
   Additionally, tutors should never input student&rsquo;s work into AI. Even though our intentions might be good, we
   must adhere to our personal information and privacy policies and avoid running student&rsquo;s work through outside
   engines.<br /><br /><strong>Conclusion</strong> <br />While you are doing a good job helping some students, we need
   to see improvement in your approach. Let's work on engaging students, working together, guiding them to find their
   own answers and solve their problems on their own.<br /><br />I am here to help! Please feel free to reach out to me
   about any questions or concerns. <br /><br />All the best, <br />Jesica Romero, Quality
